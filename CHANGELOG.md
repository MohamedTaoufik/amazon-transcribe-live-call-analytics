## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- Updated the Python GraphQL client in the Call Event Stream Processor Lambda function to the
  recently released stable version [gql v3.0.0](https://github.com/graphql-python/gql/releases/tag/v3.0.0).
  This version is now out of pre-release which removed the need for the Makefile based sam cli
  build of the Lambda layer. The library also added direct support for AppSync which removed the
  need for the custom AppSync transport and authentication code. The Makefile build and custom
  AppSync code has been deleted

    - Web UI
    - KVS Transcribe Processor Fargate container
    - Call Event Processor Lambda function
    - S3 Recording Trigger Lambda function
    - Project build and development

## [0.2.1] - 2022-02-02
### Fixed
- Fixed semantic version in main cloudformation template

## [0.2.0] - 2022-02-02
### Added
- Added script to update semantic versions in source files. `scripts/update-version.sh`
- Added TROUBLESHOOTING.md for instructions on how to check for errors
- Added web UI admin user creation via CloudFormation. The email address of the admin user is
  passed via the `AdminEmail` CloudFormation parameter. An initial temporary password is
  automatically sent to this user via email. This email also includes the link to the web UI
- Added CloudFormation parameter to enable or disable Sentiment Analysis. See the
  `IsSentimentAnalysisEnabled` parameter
- Added CloudFormation mapping to configure the Amazon Comprehend language from the selected Amazon
  Transcribe language
- Added support to select the Spanish language (es-US) in the CloudFormation template. The
  CloudFormation template now allows to select either English (en-US) or Spanish (es-US) using the
  `TranscribeLanguageCode` parameter. **NOTE:** Content redaction is only available when using the
  English language (en-US). It is automatically disabled when using other languages
- Added the `CloudFrontAllowedGeos` CloudFormation parameter to control the CloudFront geographic
  restrictions. You can specify a comma separated list of two letter country codes (uppercase ISO
  3166-1) that are allowed to access the web user interface via CloudFront. For example: US,CA.
  Leave empty if you do not want geo restrictions to be applied
### Changed
- The CloudFormation `AllowedSignUpEmailDomain` parameter is now optional. If left empty, signup
  via the web UI is disabled and users will have to be created using Cognito. If you configure a
  domain, **only** email addresses from that domain will be allowed to signup and signin via the
  web UI
- The CloudFront distribution now defaults to no geographic restrictions. There's a new parameter
  named `CloudFrontAllowedGeos` that allows you to add geographic restrictions. If you leave this
  parameter empty, the previous geographic restriction will be removed on an update to this version.
  The previous version had a hardcoded value that set the restriction to `US` only. Set the
  `CloudFrontAllowedGeos` to `US` if you want to preserve the previous default configuration after
  updating to this version
### Fixed
- Reverted kvs stream parser library version workaround
- Asterisk server will wait for voice connector to get a phone number before initializing
